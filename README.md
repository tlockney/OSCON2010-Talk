# Harnessing Java with Scala - OSCON 2010

Thomas Lockney and Trenton Lipscomb

This repository holds code used for the examples in our talk, [Harnessing Java with
Scala][HJS], given at [OSCON 2010][OSCON].

Each directory is it's own SBT project. To keep things simple, we're not using SBT's support
for subprojects, so each project will need to be compiled and run individually.
